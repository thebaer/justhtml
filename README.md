**About**

JustHTML is a simple, lazy static site generator that smushes HTML together and saves me from using PHP for simple sites. It's written in Go, so it runs on whatever platform you're on, and saves you from installing Ruby. It's made for people like me who enjoy hand-coding HTML and want to save some time updating common site elements.

It assumes you're creating your sites from scratch every time, instead of from a previous theme, and makes no assumptions about the _content_ of your site. It's just here to smush HTML.

If you're just looking for a new way to blog, get started on [Write.as](https://write.as). And there are a ton of more robust [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) out there, if this won't do it.

**Goals**

This simply solves the problem of editing common site elements across multiple pages of a website, such as headers, footers, and navigation menus. Any other problems it solves, such as site functionality or highly opinionated boilerplate code, is superfluous and better left to others.
